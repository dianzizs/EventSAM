This paper delves into the nuanced challenge of tailoring the Segment Anything Models (SAMs) for integration with event data, with the overarching objective of attaining robust and universal object segmentation within the event-centric domain. 

## Getting Started

### Installation
The code requires `python>=3.8`, as well as `pytorch>=1.7` and `torchvision>=0.8`. Please to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. Installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support is strongly recommended.

Install EventSAM:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
```

or clone the repository locally and install with

```
git clone git@github.com:facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
cd segment-anything; pip install -e .
```
### Dataset
In this work, we collected a large-scale RGB-Event dataset for event-centric segmentation, from current available pixel-level aligned datasets ([COESOT](https://sites.google.com/view/viseventtrack/) and [COESOT](https://github.com/Event-AHU/COESOT)), namely [RGBE-SEG].
